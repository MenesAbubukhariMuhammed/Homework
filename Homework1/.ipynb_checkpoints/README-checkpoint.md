# Title: Ripple: International currency exchange platform. 

## Overview and Origin

The world is becoming smaller each day and doing business is a global proposition. The supply chain is often times muddled by the currency exchange translation. The transfer of payment is compounded by the currency translation. What is it worth? How can I get the resources to satisfy my accounts is the reoccurring question in every part of the world as well as the question, what is the currency value based upon my home currency? Will I lose in the transaction base upon the currency trade?  Ripple with its own payment protocol and exchange network has a solution. Ripple provides instant liquidity. Ryan Fugger conceived Ripple in 2004 after working on a local exchange trading system in Vancouver. The intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively empower individuals and communities to create their own money.

* Name of company: Ripple (Ripple Labs, Inc.)

* When was the company incorporated? 2012.
The first iteration of Ripple was OpenCoin which began development of the ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment and exchange network. On April 11, 2013, OpenCoin announced it had closed an angel round of funding with several venture capital firms. That same month, OpenCoin acquired SimpleHoney to help it popularize virtual currencies and make them easier for average users. The company is based in San Francisco, California.
On September 26, 2013, OpenCoin officially changed its name to Ripple Labs, Inc. 

* Who are the founders of the company?
Ryan Fugger conceived Ripple in 2004 after working on a local exchange trading system in Vancouver. The intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively empower individuals and communities to create their own money. Fugger later built the first iteration of this system, RipplePay.com. Concurrently, in May 2011, Jed McCaleb began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by Bitcoin. In August 2012, Jed McCaleb hired Chris Larsen and they approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency idea. After discussions with McCaleb and long-standing members of the Ripple community, Fugger handed over the reins. In September 2012, Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb co-founded the corporation OpenCoin.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The idea of an answer for the exchange of currency has been around since the first international transaction was made. As the world became smaller because of international trade and supply chain realities currency translation became common instead of an isolated occurrence. The need for a platform to satisfy payments demanded a solution. Many companies have attempted to address this issue but Ripples model has established a platform that has satisfied the market demand for such a vehicle if it can weather regulatory complications.  Ripple’s strength is also in the network of banks that support it’s program with the open-source model and the nature of the complete tolerance for global currencies. The alternative approach with Libra has introduced relies on a basket of well traded currencies that leaves out smaller growing nations who are growing in wealth, power and influence.
Ripple was conceived by Jed McCaleb and built by Arthur Britto and David Schwartz who then approached Ryan Fugger who had debuted in 2005 as a financial service to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network. Fugger had developed a system called OpenCoin which would transform into Ripple. The company also created its own form of digital currency referred to as XRP to allow financial institutions to transfer money with negligible fees and wait-time. In 2013, the company reported interest from banks for using its payment system,
By 2018, over 100 banks had signed up, but most of them were only using Ripple's XCurrent messaging technology, while avoiding the XRP cryptocurrency due to its volatility problems. Representatives of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), whose market dominance is being challenged by Ripple, have argued that the scalability issues of Ripple and other blockchain solutions remain unsolved, confining them to bilateral and intra-bank applications. A Ripple executive acknowledged in 2018 that "We started out with your classic blockchain, which we love. But the feedback from the banks is you can’t put the whole world on a blockchain." 
Ripple relies on a common shared ledger, which is a distributed database storing information about all Ripple accounts. Chris Larsen told the Stanford Graduate School of Business that the network was managed by a network of independent servers which compare their transaction records, and that servers could in theory belong to anyone, including banks or market makers. Ripple validates accounts and balances instantly for payment transmission and delivers payment notification within a few seconds. Payments are irreversible, and there are no chargebacks. 
Ripple Labs continued as the primary contributors of code to the consensus verification system behind Ripple, which can "integrate with banks’ existing networks." Since 2013, the protocol has been adopted by an increasing number of financial institutions to "offer an alternative remittance option" to consumers. By December 2014 Ripple Labs began working with global payments service Earthport, combining Ripple's software with Earthport's payment services system. The partnership marked the first network usage of the Ripple protocol. On December 29, 2017, XRP briefly became the second largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of US$73 billion. 
Litigation
A class action was filed against Ripple in May 2018 "alleging that it led a scheme to raise hundreds of millions of dollars through unregistered sales of its XRP tokens." According to the complaint, "the company created billions of coins 'out of thin air' and then profited by selling them to the public in 'what is essentially a never-ending initial coin offering'." 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated legal proceedings against Ripple Labs, CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and co-founder Chris Larsen on December 21, 2020, for allegedly selling unregistered securities. In the lawsuit, the SEC claimed that XRP was a security instead of a commodity, because it was generated and distributed by Ripple Labs in a centralized fashion and was not being adopted by financial institutions for its advertised use cases. The SEC stated that Ripple executives sold 14.6 billion units of XRP for more than $1.38 billion to fund the company’s operations and enrich themselves. 
In response, Garlinghouse criticized the SEC and indicated that Ripple Labs would defend itself in court. Coinbase delisted XRP on December 28; an investor filed a class action on December 30 alleging that Coinbase sold XRP tokens with the understanding that they were unregistered securities. 
Reception
For its creation and development of the Ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment/exchange network Ripple Labs was named as one of 2014's 50 Smartest Companies in the February 2014 edition of MIT Technology Review. A scientific study made by two researchers from Stanford and Stockholm University that studied the money production from an energy consumption point of view and a macroeconomic level stated that running a server on Ripple was comparable to the energy needs of running an email server. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The primary source of funding Ripple has been sales of the XRP cryptocurrency. According to its own records it sold $1,254.54 million worth of XRP between Q4 2016 and Q2 2020, to a mix of institutional investors and retail investors via sales on cryptocurrency exchanges. Ripple is a privately funded company.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Developed as a currency for powering the Ripple Network, XRP allows people to send money digitally. The cryptocurrency came into being as an upgrade of Bitcoin with the aim of solving issues of high transaction costs and slow transaction speeds associated with the popular digital coin.
XRP is the native cryptocurrency for products developed by Ripple Labs. Its products are used for payment settlement, asset exchange, and remittance systems that work more like SWIFT, a service for international money and security transfers used by a network of banks and financial intermediaries4.
The Future  of Global Finance
Unlocking the Power of Blockchain
The current global payments infrastructure does not meet today’s business or consumer demands. By unlocking the  power of blockchain and digital asset technology, financial institutions can dramatically improve the speed, cost and reliability of how people transact around the world.
Creating an Inclusive Financial System
Our solutions unify the infrastructure underlying global payments. But it doesn’t stop there. Through the power  of decentralized financial technology, institutions and the businesses and people they serve have access to an open  and inclusive system no matter where they are in the world.
Accelerating the Internet of Value
This new era in global finance takes shape in the Internet  of Value (IoV)—a world where money moves like information does today. Like the internet’s impact on information sharing  and communication, the IoV will serve as an explosive catalyst for value exchange: spawning a new chapter in globalization, redefining entire industries and giving rise to new ones.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Banks and payment providers can use the digital asset XRP to further reduce their costs and access new markets. With offices in San Francisco, Washington D.C., New York, London, Mumbai, Singapore, São Paulo, Reykjavik and Dubai, Ripple has more than 300 customers around the world.Nov 6, 2019 .

Partners: Santander and Ripple Bring Faster, Cheaper Cross-Border Payments to Millions of Retail and Commercial Customers
Goal: To create innovative financial services that directly benefit customers and help people and companies prosper.
Solution: Ripple helped Santander develop its One Pay FX service that allows customers to make instant or same-day, low-cost international payments, while knowing exactly how much the recipient gets and when they will receive the money. One Pay FX has been launched in six countries and payments can be sent to two dozen countries, including all the euro zone.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Current cross-border transactions occur between technology systems that are siloed and not connected to each other. Ripple uses interledger protocol, which enables the routing of payments through interconnected ledgers to connect these systems.

## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Payments/Billing and Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Ripple is closing the gap in international payments which has been a barrier to transnational business for generations. The of the ten fastest growing economies in the world Africa has five of them. Integration of currency translation and value validation is a constant problem from the US, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. The trend in the last 5-10 years is to simplify and secure the balance of payment in transactions.
* What are the other major companies in this domain?

1. Stellar lumens (XLM)
If you’ve spent any time at all analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of Ripple, you’ll no doubt have come across comparisons between Ripple and Stellar – and with good reason. Programmer Jed McCaleb played a key role in Ripple’s development, and after he left the company following a difference of opinion, he moved on to co-found Stellar.
Similar to Ripple, Stellar also offers a distributed payments network designed to provide fast and cheap cross-border payments. By connecting banks, payment systems and people, and through the use of its lumens currency, Stellar allows international payments that can be processed within two to five seconds, with fees of 1/600,000th of a cent per transaction. There are other features to the Stellar network as well, including an ICO platform and a decentralized exchange.
Though they’re often listed as competitors, Ripple and Stellar have so far concentrated their efforts in different areas – Ripple on joining forces with major banks and financial institutions and Stellar on providing low-cost financial services to people in the developing world. However, it remains to be seen which project has adopted the more successful approach.
2. OmiseGO (OMG)
With a mission to “unbank the banked”, OmiseGO offers a peer-to-peer platform where users can quickly and securely exchange fiat and cryptocurrencies. Built on Ethereum, OmiseGO is developing a currency-agnostic decentralized exchange network capable of interacting with blockchains (eg bitcoin or Litecoin) through clearinghouses in state channels or smart contracts, as well as with digital fiat platforms through the use of collateralized fiat tokens.
OmiseGO also offers an e-wallet software development kit which is free to use and allows digital wallet providers to connect to the public OMG network so that their users can transact any digital assets.
The end goal is to overcome coordination difficulties amongst payment processors, gateways and financial institutions, providing a value transfer service that operates across currencies, asset types and national borders. Although OmiseGO is focused on the southeast Asian market, its network is designed to allow anyone to conduct real-time, peer-to-peer financial transactions, including everything from payments and remittances to B2B commerce and supply-chain finance.
If you’re searching for a cryptocurrency with similarities to Ripple, it’s well worth a closer look.

3. Nano (NANO)
Our third alternative to Ripple is something a little different. Unlike Ripple and its focus on banks and major financial institutions, Nano (NANO) is designed purely as a peer-to-peer digital currency.
Originally known as RaiBlocks, Nano offers instant, zero-fee transactions and is designed to be infinitely scalable. Launched in 2017, this innovative crypto combines blockchain with directed acyclic graph technology (DAG) in a unique “block-lattice” infrastructure. DAG systems see individual transactions directly linked to one another, offering improved scalability compared to blockchain-based systems.
In short, Nano is a payment currency and nothing more. It aims to become a viable alternative to fiat currency for everyday transactions, offering fast and cheap peer-to-peer payments all over the world.
This means it’s being developed with quite a different focus to XRP and can’t boast anything like the level of financial support or the impressive range of corporate partnerships that Ripple can. However, Nano’s features make it a viable choice for individuals and merchants, so it’s a coin worth watching closely in the months and years ahead.

•	GitHub Commits
•	Max Supply 
•	Monthly Transactions
Funding Metrics

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Ripple is number 3 under Bitcoin, Ethereum.
From the outside, the cryptocurrency investing universe seems limited to Bitcoin. As the most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is the leader in market capitalization and overall traction with investors.
But there are several other options for those interested in diversifying their portfolio and experimenting with coins that offer a different take on the concept of digital currencies. Ripple’s XRP is one of them. In March 2021, the cryptocurrency ranked fourth, behind Bitcoin, Ether, and Binance coin, in terms of total ma Bitcoin operates on a public blockchain ledger that supports a digital currency used to facilitate payments for goods and services. The bitcoin network is based on the blockchain concept, a public ledger of verified transactions and record keeping. Miners verify transactions on an ongoing basis and add them to the Bitcoin blockchain. In exchange for their time and the computing power necessary to validate the ledger in this way, miners are rewarded with BTC upon successfully validating transactions3.
XRP is the native cryptocurrency for products developed by Ripple Labs. Its products are used for payment settlement, asset exchange, and remittance systems that work more like SWIFT, a service for international money and security transfers used by a network of banks and financial intermediaries4. XRP is pre-mined and uses a less complicated method of mining as compared to Bitcoin.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would recommend that Ripple extend their focus on serving nations with real assets and limited currency translation mechanisms. This service will allow for Ripple to be in a space which has to greatest upside and future value. Ethereum an Asian based company is more focused on serving the underserve populous for Ripple to survive it has to get into the underserved customer and compete for those bucks.
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Belief is transmitted by two basic occurrences, one the first news that is told and the last word on the subject. Introducing a regime to unserved client states with resources will engender loyalty through knowledge of usage and building client loyalty understanding the market.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Ripple has hundreds of financial institutions in its network however the application of the services needs to be directed to serve commodity rich nations in a more robust manner. Using infrastructure and innovation.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Need drives demand. The cell phone changed the banking industry just as the ATM changed cash delivery using internet and infrastructure. The combination of the combination of internet and infrastructure has always shared similar spaces. The shopping mall brought products to the local town now the ecommerce sales reduced the number of shopping malls dramatically but the ecommerce giants build super distribution centers across the land to provide fast delivery of good to consumers. The application of internet and infrastructure satisfies the question of the primary to all consumption,” This is what I want and how soon can I have it”.
